# 🛠️ Project-Specific AI Agent Standards

This file contains standards, conventions, and rules specific to this project. AI Agents MUST adhere to the rules herein, in parallel with the core standards (like `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).

> **💡 Instructions:**
> - **Independent operation:** Simply create/edit this file, and the AI Agent will automatically detect it.
> - **Fully customizable:** You can add new fields (e.g., "Reviewer", "Effective Date") if necessary. Just keep it in a bulleted list format.
> - Use this file to define: project architecture, preferred libraries, naming conventions, error handling flows, etc.

## 📋 Project Standards List (Customize below)

<!-- ADD YOUR STANDARDS BELOW -->

### MCP Skill Auto-Discovery
- **Rule (Required):** Before starting any implementation, design, refactoring, or debugging task, the AI Agent MUST automatically invoke the `recommend_context(task)` tool from the `ai-agent-standards` MCP server. You must use the returned resources, principles, and skills to ground your work.
- **Reason (Required):** To ensure all coding activities comply with the 6 Core Principles and local project standards without needing explicit manual user prompts.
- **Do / Good Example:** Executing `recommend_context("implement rate limiting for Auth API")` at the beginning of the chat session.
- **Don't / Bad Example:** Coding immediately without consulting the MCP server's standards and context.
- **How to Test (Optional):** Ask the agent to list the standards/skills it loaded for the current task.
