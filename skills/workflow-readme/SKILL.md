## 🔥 VIBE CODER BLIND SPOTS COMPREHENSIVELY HANDLED

### 📐 During planning (`/plan`)
| Blind spot | AI asks itself |

## 🚀 Workflow system - NEW FEATURES

### 1️⃣ Deep Interview (3 Golden Questions)
Before proposing, AI asks 3 core questions:
- WHAT to manage?
- WHO uses it?
- What is MOST IMPORTANT?

→ Helps AI understand correctly from the beginning, avoiding errors and rework.

### 2️⃣ Lazy Checkpoint (Save tokens)
```
.brain/
├── session.json        # Update every PHASE (~450 tokens)
└── session_log.txt     # Append every TASK (~20 tokens)
```
→ Reduces token overhead by 80% compared to rewriting JSON for every task.

### 3️⃣ Proactive Handover
When context is > 80% full:
- AI auto-generates Handover Document
- Saved to `.brain/handover.md`
- Next session, type `/recap` to resume immediately

→ NEVER lose context between sessions.

### 4️⃣ Step Confirmation Protocol
After each milestone, display:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ DONE: [Task name]
📊 Progress: ████████░░ 80%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ Continue? (y/adjust/stop)
```
→ Users always know where they are, avoiding feeling "out of control".

### 5️⃣ Agent Personas (BMAD-Inspired)
| Workflow | Persona | Personality / Tone |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `/plan` | Ha (PM) | Listens, proposes options |
| `/design` | Minh (Architect) | Explains technical concepts simply |
| `/code` | Tuan (Senior Dev) | Meticulous, checks thoroughly |
| `/visualize` | Mai (UX Designer) | Visual, uses examples |
| `/debug` | Long (Detective) | Calm, methodical |
| `/audit` | Khang (Code Doctor) | Calm/reassuring tone |

## 🧠 Structured Context - v3.3 (Separate brain + session)

### Problem in v3.2
- `brain.json` contains both static and dynamic data
- Every save requires updating the entire file
- Session state is mixed with project knowledge

### Solution in v3.3: Separate into 2 files
```
.brain/                            # LOCAL (per-project)
├── brain.json                     # 🧠 Static knowledge (rarely changes)
├── session.json                   # 📍 Dynamic session (changes constantly)
└── preferences.json               # ⚙️ Local override (if different from global)

~/.ai-agent-standards/                    # GLOBAL (all projects)
├── preferences.json               # Default AI preferences
└── defaults/                      # Templates
```

### Benefits
| Metric | v3.2 | v3.3 |
|--------|------|------|
| Files to scan | 1 (brain.json) | 2 (brain + session) |
| Token usage | ~3KB | ~3KB (equivalent) |
| Update frequency | Every save | brain: when project changes, session: constantly |
| Scope | Local only | Local + Global preferences |

### Workflow
```
/save-brain → Update brain.json (if needed) + session.json (always)
/recap → Load preferences → brain.json → session.json → Summary
/customize → Save preferences (local/global/both)
```

### Schema files
- `schemas/brain.schema.json` - Project knowledge
- `schemas/session.schema.json` - Session state ⭐ NEW
- `schemas/preferences.schema.json` - User preferences ⭐ NEW

### Template files
- `templates/brain.example.json`
- `templates/session.example.json` ⭐ NEW
- `templates/preferences.example.json` ⭐ NEW

### brain.json (Static - rarely changes)
- `project`: Name, type, status
- `tech_stack`: Frontend, Backend, DB, Dependencies
- `database_schema`: Tables, Relationships
- `api_endpoints`: Routes with auth info
- `business_rules`: Business rules
- `features`: Features and statuses
- `knowledge_items`: Patterns, Gotchas, Conventions

### session.json (Dynamic - constantly changing) ⭐ NEW
- `working_on`: Feature, task, status, files being modified
- `pending_tasks`: Tasks to do next
- `recent_changes`: Recent changes
- `errors_encountered`: Errors encountered and how to fix them
- `decisions_made`: Decisions made in this session

### preferences.json (User settings) ⭐ NEW
- `communication`: Tone, persona
- `technical`: Detail level, autonomy, quality
- `working_style`: Pace, feedback style
- `custom_rules`: User's custom rules

## 🛡️ Resilience Patterns - v3.3 (Hidden from User)

> **Principle:** Users do not need to know about retry, timeout, fallback. AI handles them in the background.

### Auto-Retry (Hidden)
```
When encountering a transient error (network, rate limit):
1. Retry 1st time (wait 1s)
2. Retry 2nd time (wait 2s)
3. Retry 3rd time (wait 4s)
4. If still failing → Notify user in simple language
```

### Timeout Protection (Hidden)
```
Each task has a default timeout:
- /code: 5 minutes
- /deploy: 10 minutes
- /debug: 5 minutes
- Others: 3 minutes

Upon timeout → "This is taking too long, do you want to continue?"
```

### Fallback Conversation (Shown when needed)
```
Instead of complex syntax like: /deploy production || staging

AI asks in simple language:
"Could not deploy to production 😅
 Do you want to try staging first?
 1️⃣ Yes - Deploy staging
 2️⃣ No - I will inspect the error"
```

### Error Messages (Simplified)
```
❌ Old: "Error: ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432 - Connection refused"

✅ New: "Could not connect to database 😅
        Please check if PostgreSQL is running!
        Type /debug if you need my help."
```

### Error Categories
| Error Type | AI Action | User Sees |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Network timeout | Auto-retry 3x | Nothing (if successful) |
| Rate limit | Wait and retry | "Waiting for API..." |
| Auth failed | Report immediately | "Please check your credentials" |
| Code syntax | Suggest fix | "Error in file X, type /debug" |
| Build failed | Analyze log | "Build failed due to Y, I propose..." |

2. **Don't fear making mistakes** - `/rollback` is available
3. **`/save-brain` at the end of the day** - No context lost tomorrow
4. **`/audit` periodically** - Prevention is better than cure
5. **`/deploy` before release** - Fully covers SEO, Analytics, Legal
